# 👋 Hi, I’m Excalibur (@excaliburot)

**Performance Enthusiast | Windows Optimizer | Script Developer**

Welcome to my GitHub. I specialize in building hardcore, enthusiast-tier utilities designed to strip away OS bloat, eliminate input latency, and maximize raw hardware efficiency for competitive gaming. My goal is to provide open-source, transparent, and powerful tools that replace expensive "paid" PC optimization services.

* 👀 **I’m currently focusing on:** Deep Windows OS optimization, latency reduction (DPC/HPET/Timer tweaks), and developing lightweight, powerful scripts like the **E-Tweaks Engine**.
* 🌱 **I’m currently researching:** Advanced network stack routing, kernel-level task scheduling, and PowerShell automation.
* 💞️ **I’m looking to collaborate on:** Open-source PC optimization tools, benchmarking utilities, and competitive gaming tweaks.
* 📫 **Let's connect:** Reach out to me on Discord at **`excaliburot`** for support, collaboration, or to talk PC hardware tuning.
